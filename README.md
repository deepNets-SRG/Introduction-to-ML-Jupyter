\
**Classes:**\
\
Iris flowers are of three categories namely Versicolor, Setosa and Virginica as shown in figure. \
These three species looks one and the same but careful observation on their petals and sepals
one can distinguish them. Here we use a machine learning model to predict the sepal length of a flower based on the remaining data.

\
**Petal and Sepal:**\
\
Iris data set contains the lengths and widths of both petals and sepals of all three species of Iris flowers.\
The above picture gives the information on petal and sepal of the flower.
